This repo was created for the Handwrite Text Recognition project within the scope of Istanbul Technical University- BLG 561E Deep Learning course.

Handwritten Text Recognition

This project is a Handwritten Text Recognition (HTR) system that uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) with CTC (Connectionist Temporal Classification) to predict handwritten characters from images. The model is trained on a dataset containing images of individual letters and aims to recognize sequences of characters from handwritten words.

ðŸ“Œ Key Features

Pretrained CNN-RNN model with CTC loss for sequence prediction

Supports English uppercase letter recognition (A-Z)

Predicts entire words by combining character predictions

Allows fine-tuning on custom datasets

ðŸ›  Technologies Used

TensorFlow/Keras - Deep Learning Framework

OpenCV - Image Processing

NumPy - Array Handling

Python - Main programming language
